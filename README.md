# Factoprint

Factoprint is an online blueprinter for those times when you gotta satisfy that Cracktorio fix but don't have the game around.

## Features
* Currently all you can do is place a few items (transport-belts and splitters) and move around... Not much really

## Planned Features

* **All the in game items will be added**
* **Importing/Exporting blueprints**
* **Circuit connections**
* **Setting recipies in assemblers and such**
* **Group select to allow for features like copy/paste/mass-delete**

## Possible Features (won't happen for a while)

* **Creation of brushes**

   This would allow a user to select a group of things and be able to draw with that selection. ie. A grouping of 4 transport belts could then be drawn all at once

* **Recipe integration**

   This would allow me to give some sick-ass stats about the blueprint like potential throughput issues and other things.

* **Simulations**

   Going along with the recipe integration, something like a simulation could be implemented to show heatmaps and graphs on your system. Essentially like unit testing. Could make a simple set of commands to run a unit test on the system. 
   
## TODO

* **Add more things to the TODO**
* **Add more things to the features**
* **Actually add content**
* **Finish encapuslation of the Grid class**
